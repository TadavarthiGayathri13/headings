1) Purpose of Comments in HTML

Comments in HTML are annotations or notes added within the code that are completely ignored by the web browser. They don't affect how the page is displayed but serve several valuable purposes for developers:

* Improved Code Readability: Comments help you (and others who might work on the code later) understand the purpose of specific sections, complex logic, or non-obvious code. They act like explanations within the code itself.

* Documentation: You can use comments to document the overall structure of your HTML page, explain the use of specific elements or attributes, or provide notes about future changes or considerations.

* Temporarily Disabling Code: If you need to temporarily disable a part of your HTML code without deleting it, you can enclose it in comments. This can be useful for testing purposes or hiding content during development.

* Collaboration: When working on a project with other developers, comments can help them understand your thought process and make it easier to collaborate effectively.
 2) Example of Using Comments in HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Website - Home Page</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
  <p>
    This is the main content of my home page.
    </p>
  <p>This is another paragraph with some additional information.</p>
  </body>
</html>

3) Syntax for Creating Comments
The comment starts with ``. Anything between these tags is ignored by the browser. You can use single-line comments or multi-line comments as needed.
