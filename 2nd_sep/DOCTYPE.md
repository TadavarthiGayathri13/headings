The DOCTYPE (Document Type Declaration) in HTML is a special instruction at the very beginning of an HTML document. It's not quite an HTML tag itself, but rather an informative line that tells the web browser two things:

 1) Document Type: It informs the browser that this is an HTML document, not something else like a script or plain text.
2) HTML Version: It specifies the version of HTML the document is written in (e.g., HTML5). This helps the browser render the content according to the specific rules of that version.

3) Benefits of DOCTYPE:
* Ensures Correct Rendering: By knowing the HTML version, the browser can interpret the code accurately and display the page as intended.
* Triggers Standards Mode: The DOCTYPE helps activate a more strict mode (standards mode) in the browser, ensuring consistent rendering across different browsers.
* Future-Proofing: Specifying the version allows the browser to handle new elements and features introduced in that version.

Simple Example:
The DOCTYPE declaration for HTML5 is:
<!DOCTYPE html>
