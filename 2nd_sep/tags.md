 1) Tags and Elements in HTML:

 * Elements are the building blocks of a web page, representing its content and structure. Think of them as the individual pieces that come together to form the whole.

 * Tags, on the other hand, are instructions written in angle brackets (< and >) that define these elements. They tell the web browser what type of element it's dealing with and where the element's content begins and ends.


Example:

Let's look at a paragraph element:

* Element: Paragraph
* Opening Tag: <p>
* Content: This is the text that appears within the paragraph.
* Closing Tag: </p>
* The complete code for a paragraph might look like this:

<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>

In this example, the <p> and </p> tags define the paragraph element, and the text between them is the content that will be displayed as a paragraph in the web browser.

  Key Points:

 * Most HTML elements have both opening and closing tags.
* Some tags, like <br> (for line break), are self-closing and don't need a separate closing tag.
 * Tags provide structure and meaning to the content, allowing browsers to format and display the page correctly.
